## Basics 

JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed

when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. 

Nested arrays 
var myArray = [[],[]];

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];
// Retorna 8 
var myData = myArray[2][1];
